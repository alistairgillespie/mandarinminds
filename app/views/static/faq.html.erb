</div>
<div class="question"><p><i class="fa fa-plus"> </i><i class="fa fa-minus"> </i><b>What is a free trial lesson?</b></p></div>

<p class="answer">A free trial lesson allows you to try out half a lesson (25 minutes) to get a feel for what a lesson is and what to expect. From here you will be able to determine if you are comfortable with this style of learning. During this lesson you will discuss your goals and appropriate course material will be recommended by the teacher.</p>

<div class="question"><p><i class="fa fa-plus"> </i><i class="fa fa-minus"> </i><b>When can I take lessons?</b></p></div>

<p class="answer">Absolutely, when you book a class you can filter our calendar system to only show the teacher of your choice. However you are free to book with any teacher you wish and are not locked in to having the same one every time.</p>

<div class="question"><p><i class="fa fa-plus"> </i><i class="fa fa-minus"> </i><b>How do the video lessons work? Do I need any special software?</b></p></div>

<p class="answer">Our teachers utilise the free video-calling software <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> to contact you and so'll you need to have a Skype account and downloaded the program before you can partake in any lessons. Once you've signed up we only need your username so that our teachers can get in touch with you. If you prefer you can instead use the Skype app, available on most smart phone app stores.</p>

<p class="answer">At the conclusion of your first lesson with a new teacher she will provide you with her e-mail address which you can use to exchange materials. Teachers will be unable to arrange lessons via e-mail, so please book lessons yourself within the portal.</p>

<div class="question"><p><i class="fa fa-plus"> </i><i class="fa fa-minus"> </i><b>Can I get a refund on my package?</b></p></div>
